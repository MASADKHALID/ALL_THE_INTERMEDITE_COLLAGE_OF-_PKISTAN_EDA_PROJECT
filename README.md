ðŸš€ **Excited to share my latest data cleaning, SQL integration, and Power BI visualization project!** ðŸš€

I've been working on a dataset of intermediate colleges in Pakistan, and here's how I tackled the challenge:

**-Loaded Data:** 
  Used pandas to read the CSV file and understand its structure.

**-Column Consistency**: 
  Renamed 'Study Program' to 'Study_Program' for uniformity.

**-Data Types Check:** 
  Identified that all columns were initially of object type.

**-Cleaning 'Rating' Column:** 
  Removed unwanted characters (like '*') and converted the values to float.

**-Handling Missing Values:** 
  Standardized missing entries in the 'Affiliation' column by replacing 'nan' with None.

**-After cleaning the data, I moved on to SQL integration:**


**-SQL Table Creation:** 
  Created a table in SQL to store the cleaned data.

**-Bulk Insert:** 
  Imported the cleaned dataset into the SQL table for further analysis.

**-Data Querying:** 
  Performed queries to extract and analyze specific insights from the dataset.

**-And finally, I took the project a step further with Power BI:**


**Connecting SQL to Power BI: 
    Connected the SQL database to Power BI for seamless data import.**

**-Data Visualization:**
   Created interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends in the dataset.

**-Insights Generation:** 
  Leveraged Power BI's powerful features to generate valuable insights and present them in a visually appealing manner.
